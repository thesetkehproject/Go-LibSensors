# Go-LibSensors
lm-sensors LibSensors implimented in Go.

[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/thesetkehproject/Go-LibSensors/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/thesetkehproject/Go-LibSensors/latest)

The Goal of this project is to impliment the [libsensors](http://www.lm-sensors.org/browser/lm-sensors/trunk/lib/sensors.h?rev=5844) API from sensors.h in Go so Eliza can monitor system temps using lm_sensors so we dont have to interact with /sys/class/hwmon.
